## Coding BootCamp React Project I

- This a React application that demonstrates utilization of components.

#### Functionality / How to play

- At the beginning of the game the page will render a set of different images.
- You can click an image to remove it.
- The images will shuffle after a click. 
- If you click the same image a second time the game is over.
- The game will track your score and the score is incremented when an image is clicked for the first time.
- Once an incorrect guess is made the score will tally and the game should restart.
