This is a memory game. The goal is to avoid clicking the same image twice. The score will tally each time you click a unique image.

- At the beginning of the game the page will render a set of different images.
- You can click an image to select it.
- The images will shuffle after a click. 
- If you click the same image a second time the game is over.
- The game will track your score and the score is incremented when an image is clicked for the first time.
- Once an incorrect guess is made the score will tally and the game will restart.
